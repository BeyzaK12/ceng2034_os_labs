ASSIGNMENT 1: Write a program to run python or bash file in chroot jail securely.

1- Create a new chroot jail.
2- Check chroot is successes or not.
3- Run a bash or Python script in the chroot jail.


My assignment consists two part:
First part is that creating a chroot jail.
Checking chroot that is success or not
and running a bash script in the chroot jail
is second part. For the second part,
x1.sh has to be in "assignment1" folder.

First, the chroot jail will be created and
bash shell will start working in the directory specified as chroot.
After this point, for my assignment's second part,
we should write "./x1.sh".
Thus, we will see that our chroot jail is successful
and the bash script can run in the chroot jail,
if and only if the script is in the chroot folder.
